// Installation Controller
// Should this be "AdminController?"
// - if no user is in db, assume we're looking for Installation (create user, tables etc...)
// - if user, log in
// - provide
//     - scaffolding for each model
//     - installation / db structure update (need a tool to monitor changes?).  Can we get it to do keys, indexes and relations too?
//     - import / export data (both to move servers or for test content)
